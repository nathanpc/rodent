external requirements (apart from a `cc`, `make`, etc.):

- [libtap](https://github.com/zorgnax/libtap)

## Running the tests

The test suite is based on the [Test Anything Protocol](https://testanything.org)
so you should be familiar with its output before running the tests.

To run the entire test suite all that's needed is:

```sh
make
make run
```
