A modern, native, [Gopher](https://gopher.floodgap.com/gopher/gw?a=gopher%3A%2F%2Fgopher.floodgap.com%2F1%2Fgopher)
client for new and old computers.

## Old Computer Challenge

The idea for this client came about during the 2024 [Old Computer Challenge](http://occ.deadnet.se/).
I was looking for a nice native client to browse the gopherspace, since
[OverbiteFF](http://gopher.floodgap.com/overbite/) was feeling a bit too slow on
my Power Mac G5, and was shocked to know that there were no newer graphical
clients available.
